For examples of my work, you can visit:

 - [libby.cards](https://www.libby.cards): For a site created for my wife when she was in medical school, intended to seamlessly handle thousands of digital note cards in a study deck without breaking a sweat. [Code](https://github.com/jacksonStone/Lit.Cards)

 - [theologian.chat](https://www.theologian.chat): For a site with a hand rolled authentication system and a thin wrapper around ChatGPT allowing a user to talk to some of the greats in the Christian Tradition. [Code](https://github.com/jacksonStone/theologianchat)

 - [My public github repositories](https://github.com/jacksonStone?tab=overview&from=2019-12-01&to=2019-12-31): For little side projects and contract work I've done over the years in between changing diapers.
