For examples of my work, you can visit:

 - [theologian.chat](theologian.chat): For a site with a hand rolled authentication system and a thin wrapper around ChatGPT allowing a user to talk to some of the greats in the Christian Tradition.

 - [libby.cards](libby.cards): For a site created for my wife when she was in medical school, intended to seamlessly handle thousands of digital note cards in a study deck without breaking a sweat.

 - [My public github repositories](https://github.com/jacksonStone/): For little side projects and contract work I've done over the years in between changing diapers.
