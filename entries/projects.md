For examples of my work, you can visit:

 - [libby.cards](https://www.libby.cards): For a site created for my wife when she was in medical school, intended to seamlessly handle thousands of digital note cards in a study deck without breaking a sweat. [Code](https://github.com/jacksonStone/Lit.Cards)

 - [theologian.chat](https://www.theologian.chat): For a site with a hand rolled authentication system and a thin wrapper around ChatGPT allowing a user to talk to some of the greats in the Christian Tradition. [Code](https://github.com/jacksonStone/theologianchat) The UI is ugly _as sin_ (get it?) because the UI code and the banner image is entirely AI generated. I went AI bananas on this one.

 - [My public github repositories](https://github.com/jacksonStone?tab=overview&from=2019-12-01&to=2019-12-31): For little side projects and contract work I've done over the years in between changing diapers.

 - [iOS/Android Game: Color Locks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCmhH7DM1Ew): Though no longer listed on the Play Store or the App Store, this was a game I developed along with two peers in college. It was targeted at art students who need to develop a nack for color theory.
