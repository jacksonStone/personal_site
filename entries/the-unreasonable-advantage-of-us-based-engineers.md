# The Unreasonable Advantages of Being an English-speaking U.S. Based Engineer

Much ink has been spilled on the inevitable demise of the U.S. based software engineering industry. The arguements are multifaceted and still common place today. From the dramatic cost reduction of offshore engineering, to No-Code tools, and most recently - to the "Rise of AI". Chicken littles abound. 

I've come to believe these arguements come from a place of sensationalism, uncertanity, doubt, or in many cases ignorance of the on-the-ground realities. The truth is, I believe, this is a wonderful career path and it will remain so for decades for U.S. based citizens. Especially them, in fact. Let me explain some of the competitive advantages that may not be readily obvious.

(As a preface, I am not claiming these advantages are "Fair" or "Just". I mean to highlight them, not declare moral judegement on them. Those of us in the U.S. should recognize the advantages we have and, with humility, make use of them)

## Unreasonable Advantage 1: Digital Technology's Native Language is English

If I said the native tounge of computers is english would you agree? On the surface this seems obviously wrong. Computers serve people literally all over the world. And if computer's had a native language it wouldn't be any human language. It would be binary, right? Not quite. Modern technology we deal with today is built on top of technology after technology. For you to read this blog post now, you had to of requested it through your mouse and keyboard, interfacing with your operating system, to open your browser, send a request over the internet, to my server which itself runs an operating system to pull the blog post into memeory and return it back to your browser to be rendered. Every step in the process is driven by several English-defined interfaces and these foundational building blocks are ubiquitous in all software, and no one is building ex-nihilo. 

What do I mean by English-defined interfaces? For starters:

### 1. Operating Systems speak English

Most servers run on what is called a "POSIX-compliant" Operating system today. POSIX is an international standard describing how an operating system should behave and what they can do. All such capabilities and functions of the system are defined in, you guessed it, English. If one wants a deep understanding of these systems - the first building block is English. Without English, you are swimming upstream requiring a pocket dictionary handy at every turn. (And for the 30% or so Servers that aren't POSIX-compliant - they are predominantly Windows machines which are likewise english-based) To build complex software that needs to interface directly with the operating system, you need to understand these interfaces and so need to have a strong grasp of English. 

### 2. Programming Languages speak English

All Programming languages with any market penetration today are defined in English. All of them. Even Ruby, which originated from Japan, is english based. This is an amazing fact that as native english speakers, U.S. based developers may never really think about or appreciate. Fortran, Java, JavaScript, C, Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, etc. All of these languages' key words are English words. Meaning even if you do not speak english and you want to code, you will need to know many english idioms. And if you have a non-latin-based alphabet language, like Manderian, you often can't include your native language in code comments or variable names and your program still compile. English alphabet is expected in these cases. All this to say, every piece of software you interface with today was almost certainly written in English. Even if you are getting hacked by some Prussian-based Black hat organization, the code they used to "pwn you" was written in English.

As one small data point of this I can recall during my time interning at Oak Ridge National Labs, I had several Chinese-born coworkers who had immigrated to the U.S. Something I noticed was they would converse with each other in their native language over lunch, I would occasionally hear "For-Loop". It was then that I realized the world-wide, international term for a for-loop is... well... "For-Loop". Amazing. 

### 3. Technical Documentation speaks English

The vast majority of Documentation/Tutorials are likewise in English, especially official documentation. It's not just the key words and the charecters you have to use in your code - but the vast majority of guides and written material are all in english. It is common even when seeing content produced by individuals living in areas where english is not the primary language, their content is in English. This is a natural expectation considering the language bias is inherint in the programming languages themselves.

To provide an analogy, say all natural science reasearch was described entirely in Portuguese. All papers, results, all that, Portuguese. This would present huge challenges for a non-native Portuguese speakers and one would rightfully expect for countries like Brazil to have a disproportionate amount of Nobel laureates. If for no other reason than their young people had one less barrier to cross to get into the game. It also acts as a barrier for the subset of the population of a nation that might be profiecient in technical/abstract thinking but has poor skills in learning other languages (of which I would include myself) Some percentage of people will be filtered out due to this added English barrier.

Learning to code is hard enough. Learning to code in a language that is not your native language is even harder. The task a non-english speaker has before them is doubly daunting. If you are a native english speaker or speak english fluently, you're starting on second base here, big time. Little did you know speaking english is half the battle. If you want to get into tech and you already speak english, from a global perspective you're 50% there and didn't even know it.

### 4. The Internet speaks English

The predominant way to do the majority of interent-based interactions is with HTTP (Hyper Text Transport Protocol). This protocol is specified in... wait for it... English. Even if you are a Switzerland based company building a site that doesn't have a lick of English in the content, the protocol by which you are fetching that information is specified in English. The developers for this site have to see and read (or at least have memorized and understand enough) of english. HTTP includes concepts like "Headers" all of which are english (Even to specify a user should recieve a language other than English requires a "Accept-language" header (which is english)) 

All browser debugging tools are english. Concepts like Cookies, Local Storage, Session Storage, Caching, all of these are english-defined concepts. It is not possible to do any kind of web development without English knowledge.
